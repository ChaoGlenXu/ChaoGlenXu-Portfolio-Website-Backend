# 🗄️ Chao (Glen) Xu — Portfolio Backend (Sanity CMS)

This is the **backend for my personal portfolio website**, built with **Sanity CMS** to manage and serve dynamic content such as projects, skills, professional experience, testimonials, and contact form messages. I built this backend to power my full-stack portfolio, allowing easy content updates via a headless CMS.

## 🌐 Frontend & Live Demo

- **Frontend GitHub Repository:** [ChaoGlenXu-Portfolio-website](https://github.com/ChaoGlenXu/ChaoGlenXu-Portfolio-website)  
- **Live Portfolio Website:** [chaoglenxu-portfolio.netlify.app](https://chaoglenxu-portfolio.netlify.app/)

The frontend is built with React, Framer Motion, SCSS, and JavaScript, and it fetches content dynamically from this backend via Sanity CMS.
